PROBLEMS I FACED WHILE DOING THIS PROJECT

1. IMPORTING DATASET 
		My csv file contains 8807 records but only 100 records were being imported into the workbench.
		Reasons:
			1. my workbench has a limit to importing data or maybe skip rows checkbox is checked
					I could not find the skip row or any other factor stating the row limit in import wizard option.
							solution to this was to explicitly load data with the help of code lines.
									PROBLEM: my workbench has access restrictions so data can't be loaded from local file
										SOLUTION: 1.change the settings from both client and server side.
														client side done, server side could not understand how to do it.
												  2.globally define local=1 for that particular project
														successfully done this but again problem occurs that mysql does not have permission to read the file.
														isk aage kya krna hai smjh nh aa rha. tired now 
			2. my dataset is not clean and contain blank spaces, unusual quotes or delimiters, or contains corrupted characters.
			        not checked
			3. excel might save data in ansi format rather than utf-8 which is used by sql.
					converted to utf-8
2. FIRST QUESTION
		I was receiving a syntax error
			Reason:
				I wrote count (*).
					SOLUTION: the correct syntax is count(*). there is no space between count and *.
						reason being if we add space then count is simply being used as a keyword and not a function call.
